## How to Add Images
1. Place your images in the `/images` folder.
2. Update the `script.js` file to include the correct image file names in the `images` array for each option.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality (floating box, image carousel).

## Future Improvements
- Add more categories and designs.
- Improve the image carousel with smoother transitions.
- Make the design fully responsive for mobile devices.
